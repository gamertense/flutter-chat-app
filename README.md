# Chat app

A chat app taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). Some differences to the course are:

- The app is built with the latest version of Flutter (v3.3.6).
- All dependencies are at the latest version as on February 9, 2023.
- Some code refactoring
- Use `dart:developer log()` function instead of `print()` function because it is the recommended way for application logging on Flutter document.
- Only tested notifications on Android emulator.
- Define typedef for the callback function in `lib/widgets/auth/auth_form.dart`
